# Cryptography course CLI

This repository is a home to a CLI used to complete and present different tasks for the Cryptography course at
Politechnika Pozna≈Ñska CS faculty.

Run `get_test_files.sh` to fetch a selected set of text files which can be used to test the algorithms both implemented
by me and imported from other libraries.

To get a general help for the CLI itself and all of it's subcommands run it with `-h` or `--help`. Bear in mind the args
parser created here (with `argparse`) is **FAR** from perfect, try to be precise when executing commands and don't be
surprised if the CLI won't stop you from doing oddities.
